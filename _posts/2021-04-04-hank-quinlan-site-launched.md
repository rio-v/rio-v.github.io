According to Motulsky (2014), under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, the probability of observing a phenomenon of equal or greater magnitude than the one observed in the current study is what a p-value tells the researcher conducting the study. As much as we want to know how likely the null hypothesis is given the data we’ve collected, what a p-value actually tells you is how unlikely the data is assuming that the null hypothesis is true (Motulsky, 2014). In addition, it is important to note that the p-value is a probability of observing a phenomenon of equal or greater magnitude, and not a measure of the magnitude itself (Motulsky, 2014). I think this is a key distinction made by Motulsky that you would do well to remember. If you want to report the effect size of the study, then report the effect size (Motulsky, 2014). Don’t use the p-value as a measure of the effect size. 
	In conclusion, the p-value is the likelihood of observing a phenomenon of equal or greater magnitude compared to what was observed in the current study. It is not a measure of effect size, and should never be used as one.
